# Illinois Population News Analysis

## Problems

Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth.
The objective is to:

1. Identify the key reasons for the declining population (what people like / dislike about Chicago / suburbs) by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text
2. Provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this trend (how to make Chicago / suburbs more attractive)

**Data Source**: a collection of ~200K news articles (about 500 MB).  The news articles are related to either Chicago and / or Illinois.

## Methods
1. Topic Detection
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Entity Recognition

## Results

### Executive Summary - Major Insights
1. Illinois, along with other major states such as New York and California, has been experiencing negative population growth for the past few years, including 2017, 2018, 2019, and the record-breaking 2021.
2. The population grows slightly in 2020 but it was not sustained the following year.
3. This population issues are mostly narrated in a very political way by both Democratic and Republican parties to stir
public opinion towards their opponentsâ€™ actions or inactions.
4. Some of the main reasons for the population decline are attributed to:
   - the rising crime,
   - high income taxes,
   - declining job market,
   - where they are all exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
5. There are some positive highlights from Illinois that hopefully can attract the businesses and residents back:
   - government effort to increase investment to boost job market (such as training, apprenticeship),
   - growing and stronger diversity within the communities,
   - continuous effort of health care improvement from Medicare allocation to programs such as Sidecar Health (note: information extracted from Named Entity Recognition findings)
6. Accordingly, businesses may be attracted to the increased investment and residents may be attracted to the more
vibrant communities and seeing government efforts to improve job opportunities.

### Actionable Recommendations
1. Government can possibly focus to improve on the areas which cause most people to flee the region:
   - Crime: balancing between short and long-term strategies for crime handling and prevention to curb the
number of crimes over time
   - Income Taxes: introduce business incentives as a manifestation of optimal tax utilization
   - Job market: continuous investment to improve job market and supply vs. demand issues
   - COVID-19: recovery activities, improve health care program/ innovations
2. Regarding the growing diversity, government can also focus more on strengthening communities and improve health and safety altogether.
