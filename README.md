# Illinois Population News Analysis

## Problems

Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth.
The objective is to:

1. Identify the key reasons for the declining population (what people like / dislike about Chicago / suburbs) by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text
2. Provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this trend (how to make Chicago / suburbs more attractive)

**Data Source**: a collection of ~200K news articles (about 500 MB).  The news articles are related to either Chicago and / or Illinois.

## Results

Executive Summary - Major Insights
● Illinois, along with other major states such as New York and California, has been experiencing negative population growth for the past few years, including 2017, 2018, 2019, and the record-breaking 2021.
● The population grows slightly in 2020 but it was not sustained the following year.
● This population issues are mostly narrated in a very political way by both Democratic and Republican parties to stir
public opinion towards their opponents’ actions or inactions.
● Some of the main reasons for the population decline are attributed to:
○ the rising crime,
○ high income taxes,
○ declining job market,
○ where they are all exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
● There are some positive highlights from Illinois that hopefully can attract the businesses and residents back:
○ government effort to increase investment to boost job market (such as training, apprenticeship),
○ growing and stronger diversity within the communities,
○ continuous effort of health care improvement from Medicare allocation to programs such as Sidecar Health
(note: information extracted from Named Entity Recognition findings)
● Accordingly, businesses may be attracted to the increased investment and residents may be attracted to the more
vibrant communities and seeing government efforts to improve job opportunities.
